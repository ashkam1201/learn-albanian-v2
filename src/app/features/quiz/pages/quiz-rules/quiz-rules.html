  <h2>How the quiz works</h2>

<p>You will be shown a word and asked to translate it.
Sometimes you need to translate from Albanian to English, and sometimes from English to Albanian.
The target language will always be written under the word, so you know which language to translate into.</p>

<p>There is a hint button you can use if you are really stuck.
Try to use it only when you truly don’t know the answer.
If you’re unsure, take your time and think it through first — that’s how you learn best.</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun learning!</p>
